# angular js quick start

This project is associated with my Angular JS Quick Start presentation:
http://prezi.com/jp2qyqrbj-wa/not-ready-yet-angular-js-quick-start/

I started with the angular-seed project

Each branch of this project is part of different concepts I am discussing in the presentation.  I've created some basic iTunes API calls to return data and use that in other concepts such as directives and services.

## step1 (branch)

Two way binding example - typical example with Angular JS showing how angular automatically handles updates either on the view or in the controller.  Discuss routing.

## step2 (branch)

Display concepts of a function call, ng-repeat, http call (to Apple iTunes data).

## step3 (branch)

Created a service (instead of the direct function call in the controller) and use the service (factory).

## step4 (branch)

Implement a basic directive to display a cost bar line (higher cost, wider the line)

## step5 (branch)

Show basic filtering (filter the results of the iTunes data).
